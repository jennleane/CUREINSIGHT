                    <h1> Prenatal Care</h1>
          <p> Prenatal care is the foundation of a healthy pregnancy.
             It involves regular check-ups to monitor the mother's physical and emotional health, as well as the baby’s development. 
             Key components include taking a complete health history, performing physical exams, providing prenatal vitamins, 
             monitoring fetal growth, and educating the mother on proper nutrition, lifestyle, and warning signs of complications. 
             Early and consistent prenatal care can significantly reduce the risks of pregnancy-related issues and ensure better 
             outcomes for both mother and baby.</p>

                    <h1>Intrapartum Care</h1>
          <p> Intrapartum care focuses on the period from the onset of labor to the delivery of the placenta.
             During this critical phase, nurses monitor maternal vital signs, assess fetal heart rate, and track the progress of 
             labor using tools like the partograph. Supportive care—such as pain relief, breathing techniques, 
             and emotional reassurance—is also essential. Nurses must be prepared to manage normal deliveries as well as
              identify and respond to complications such as prolonged labor, fetal distress, or emergency interventions like 
              cesarean sections.</p>

                    <h1>Postpartum and Newborn Care</h1>
          <p> The postpartum period, also known as the puerperium,
             begins after the delivery of the baby and continues for about six weeks.
              During this time, maternal recovery is closely monitored, including uterine involution, lochia discharge,
               and emotional well-being. Nurses provide guidance on breastfeeding, newborn care, and family planning.
                Newborn care includes APGAR scoring, thermal regulation, cord care, and early initiation of breastfeeding. 
                Nurses also educate mothers on recognizing signs of postpartum depression and newborn
                 illness to ensure a safe recovery for both.</p>
